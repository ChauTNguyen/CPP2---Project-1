# CPP2---Project-1
Our first C++ 2 Project. It's a program that reads in a list of candidates and just displays a bunch of stuff depending on
the user input.

For the first half of the semester, the project was implemented through doubly-linked lists. In the second half of the
semester, we replaced that with the STL:vector class. 

We had to follow a strict style guideline (exs: NULL instead of nullptr, no initialization lists) just so everyone can focus
on the implementation part and so our code is similar enough for easier grading. However, after we finished the project and
turned it in, I re-coded parts of the projects with C++ 11 features just for fun; I found that C++ 11 features help reduce code A LOT.
